                          As we observe on the above image, the light behavior by entering the stone shifts remarkably according to cut proportions.
                          A well cut diamond with symmetrical and straight facets will reflect light beautifully, i.e. light enters through the upper part or crown, then refracts on inner walls and goes back up through the crown, providing the diamond’s signature sparkle. On the contrary, when perfect proportions are not achieved, i.e. diamond is shallow or deep, light escapes through the pavillion.
                        </p><p class="justificado">
                        This is how you grade a diamond cut: Poor, Acceptable, Good, Very Good and Ideal. The keys to get to this classification are symmetry, polish and proportions.
                        </p><p class="justificado">
                        The four attributes of diamond quality, the 4 C’s, are all of utmost importance. However, the single attribute that man has the ability to perfect on a stone, is the diamond cut, task that must be performed only by experts.

                          The cut of the stone is connected to all the other attributes of quality. The cut will influence the diamond carat weight and the geometric proportions will affect the diamond color. A superb polishing can even help to get rid of external blemishes and therefore naturally enhance the diamond clarity.

                        <p class="justificado"><b>The difference between the cut of a diamond and the making of a diamond.</b></p>
                        <p class="justificado">
                        In Nature there are no two rough diamonds identical. Performing a diamond cut is the ability of getting the best possible product from a  rough. By definition, the cut is the preset faceted arrangement of the diamond. Since it is through the cut that the finished product is made, how the faceted arrangement is created is referred to as the 'make' of the diamond.
                        </p>

                        <h4>COLOR </h4>

                            <li>The second C is for Color, since is what the eye observes right after the glow and brightness of the stone.</li>

                            <li>The color of a diamond makes reference to the lack of color (this applies only to colorless diamonds). As diamonds approaches to the colorless level they get the best grade, except for Natural Fancy Color Diamonds, see Learn about Fancy Color Diamonds.</li>


                      <li>olorless diamonds or “white” exist on a scale that has many hues, from bright colorless to pale yellow. These subtle differences are graded from “D” (colorless) until “Z” (light yellow) and are grouped into these 6 categories:

                        <h4>CLARITY</h4>

                        <p class="justificado">The definition of what diamond clarity is, describes the diamond's whole appearance in relation to the number of both internal and external imperfections in the stone. Each stone is assessed and then graded according to a standardized grading scale.
                        </p><p class="justificado">
                          Diamond clarity is divided into six categories, of which many contain a number of clarity grades. As the clarity grades move along the scale to a lower clarity grade, the overall value of the diamond decreases. Still, even though the clarity grade may drop, it might not necessarily affect the overall
                           appearance of the stone.
                        </p><p class="justificado">
                          The table below defines the different levels of clarity for both white and color diamonds.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justificado">
                            In a colorless diamond, clarity is a very important feature to keep in mind. However, diamond clarity does not play as much of an important role in fancy colored diamonds as it does in colorless stones. When choosing a fancy colored diamond, the color and intensity are far more important than the clarity of the diamond.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Carat</h4>
                        </p><p class="justificado">
                        The weight greatly impacts the cost of the stone since the cost increases considerably per carat. For instance, a 1.00 carat diamond is not exactly half the price of a 2.00 carat diamond. If the weight drops, even if it is only by a few points down to the lower carat weight, the price of the stone will be significantly lowered.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justificado">
                          A carat refers to the unit of measure used to describe the weight of the diamond. A long time ago, because of their size, the seeds of the Carob were used on precision scales as units of weight for small quantities of precious stones. This tradition continued through time, thus we refer to the measurement unit as carat.

                        </p><p class="justificado">
                        Diamonds that come with a grading report will indicate the exact weight to the nearest hundredth of a carat weight. Each carat is divided into 100 points, so if a diamond weighs 1/2 of a carat, meaning 50 points, its weight would be recorded as 0.50 ct

                    It was the first lab in the world in sealing its diamonds for security reasons. In addition they patented the IGI Laserscribe System Mark which is used to inscribe identification data on the stone using a laser beam. Also it was one of the first labs able to identify treated natural diamonds and synthetic diamonds.

Why Antwerp? Since 1447 it’s been synonym with diamonds with the oldest set of rules record to commercialize goods, said document establishes that  "no one within the city of Antwerp is to buy, sell, pawn or pass on any false stones imitating diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires..."

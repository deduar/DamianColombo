                        <h3>Engagement Rings</h3><br>
                        <h4>Why diamonds are used for engagement rings?</h4>
                        <p class="justificado">
                        There are certain things that have become symbols, icons, for whatever reason. In the domain of engagements and marriage, a diamond ring is simply the most important icon. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="justificado">
                        Diamonds weren’t always considered a jewel. When they were first discovered thousands of years ago in India, they were used as decorations and as talismans to. Later they were used to “cure” diseases. It was only about a thousand years ago that diamonds were used as jewelry for the first time. A few centuries later, in 1477 the first man proposed with a diamond ring. This was Archduke Maximilian of Austria who asked Mary of Burgundy to be his wife. And there began a custom of proposing with diamond rings, although it was chiefly reserved for the upper class. While this was the first documented case of a diamond engagement ring, it is by no means the first engagement ring. That tradition has roots that date back to ancient Egypt when reed rings were placed on one another’s ring finger to symbolize their engagement. The ring finger was chosen because it was believed there was a vein in that finger that was connected directly to the heart, symbolizing love.

                        <h4>Choosing the perfect diamond ring</h4>
<p class="justificado">
                        One of the issues people usually come across is that the perfect diamond ring isn’t always easy to find. Here are few tips aiming to help you find the perfect ring with the “right” diamond.
</p>
                        <ul class="list">

                            <li>A Natural Diamond

                            Make sure that the stones you are looking at are natural diamonds or natural fancy color diamonds. Unnaturally enhanced color stones will lose their value and their quality over time.

                            </li><li>Budget

                            Prepare a budget before you start looking around. Efforts should be made to get a professional advice that allows you to know the whole range of available options.

                            </li><li>Color and clarity balance

                            If your choice goes to a fancy colored diamond, then the color of the stone stands out between the 4 C’s. But if your preference goes to a colorless stone, then a balance between the 4 C’s is paramount. Most of the times selecting a stone that appears clean to the naked eye is the most cost effective choice.

                            </li><li>Color

                            At the beginning of the selection process it helps to lessen the large choice of stones, while keeping your budget in mind, narrow your selection between 0.50-1.00 or 1.00-1.50 or 2.00-3.00 and it will help save you time and annoyance throughout the process. 

                            </li><li>Diamond certification

                            Always request to see the diamond certificate. So you can confirm the authenticity of the diamond and its quality. Most diamond certificates include detailed information about the stones, such as the shape, measurements, weight, color, and more. 

                            </li><li>Get professional advice

                            It’s of the utmost importance to get professional advice when looking for diamonds. It’s already hard enough to possess the expertise to assess and appraise colorless stones, much more when it comes to natural fancy color diamonds.

                            </li><li>Get involved in the process.

                            Selecting the perfect stone and get the right ring design is not an easy task. Don’t rush into a decision until you know for sure that you got the diamond ring of your dreams
                        </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4><b>What does it take to make a ring an engagement ring?</b></h4>

</p><p class="justificado">
                        Wearing and receiving an engagement ring is an established tradition, regardless of race, religion and culture. But, what constitutes an engagement ring? Engagement rings are different from ordinary rings and other special-occasion rings in some ways, but at the same time, the topic is open to different interpretations, since most cultures have different traditions concerning engagement rings. We believe that nowadays the personal touch is the defining feature to consider because it depends on which aspect you decide to stress; for instance the size of the stone, maybe the color, the shape, you could even choose a gemstone instead of a diamond. The range of options available is huge indeed, so an engagement ring can look any way you desire.

                        <p class="justificado">
                        Many people think that diamond rings are exclusively meant for engagement rings but reality is far from that concept, since diamonds are present in many designs and serve to several purposes, e.g. gala nights, dress rings, men rings, etc.</p>

                            No, absolutely not. A one diamond ring is enough.
                            </p>

                        <p class="justificado">
                        No. For quite some time men have been requiring wedding bands with diamonds as well.

                        <h4>Learning about Gold</h4>
                        <p class="justificado">
                        Gold is the king of materials used in jewelry, but why? It’s a natural element which keeps its properties changeless when exposed to air and water. It’s a malleable metal, a condition that makes it ideal for jewelry.
                        Gold is measured in karats (not carats as in diamonds) and is defined by how pure it is. So, pure gold is equal to 24 karats (24 k), this latter and 22 k are too soft for jewelry manufacturing, so both 18 k and 14 k are the most used. 18 k means 75% of pure gold and 14 k is 58,3 % gold, therefore the rest is a combination with other metals which give the required strength to be crafted into jewelry pieces. 
                        The content of every specific metal alloy is what gives the color of the gold. In its pure form, i.e. 24 k, gold is yellow but thanks to different combinations can be white, rose, blue, etc. 
                        </p>
